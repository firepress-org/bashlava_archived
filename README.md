# BashLava

BashLaVa is a utility-first bash framework. The idea is to abstract your workflow to minimize the time to do some repetitive actions.

It's for developers that use git commands regularly. BashLaVa makes following git workflow a breeze without having to leave your terminal or use GitHub GUI.

In other word, the the **agile release cycle** should be something you master. BashLaVa helps you big time to get there.
