> BashLaVa makes your bash scripts a bunch of pieces of cakes.

# BashLava

BashLaVa is a utility-first bash framework. The idea is to abstract your workflow to minimize the time to do some repetitive actions.

It's for developers that use git commands regularly. BashLaVa makes following git workflow a breeze without having to leave your terminal or use GitHub GUI.

In other word, the the **agile release cycle** should be something you master. BashLaVa helps you big time to get there.

## BashLaVa Demo

Videos WIP

**It also allows you**:

- quickly set your custom scripts (Videos WIP)
- quickly write help function
- hack around as it's all built with bash

## Installation

Step-by-step on YouTube (video wip)

- 1. git **clone** this repo

- 2. **create a symlink** to your PATH for both files.

```
ln -s /Volumes/myuser/Github/firepress-org/bashlava/bashlava.sh /usr/local/bin/bashlava.sh

ln -s /Volumes/myuser/Github/firepress-org/bashlava/.bashcheck.sh /usr/local/bin/.bashcheck.sh
```

Assuming your $path is `/usr/local/bin`

- 3. **Test your installation**. run: `bashlava.sh test`

## Requirements

- A Mac OS: I didn't test BashLaVa on other systems. _Let's me know if you want to help for this :)_
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/): (needed for markdown viewer, password generator, lint checker, etc.)
- [gh (github cli)](https://cli.github.com/): needed to create PR on GitHub
